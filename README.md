#### PUPOSE OF THIS PROJECT

This first project is a way to test what we have learned during the first module in the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp.

I am:

- Importing databases through SQL queries using 'sqlalchemy'
- Complementing our databases with data coming from an API
- Complementing our databases with data using webscraping
- Cleaning all databases in order to remove those results that are irrelevant for completing our task
- Merging all databases into a .csv that will be used as our final result

#### OBJECTIVE

In this project, I'm creating a hypothetical scenario in which I am working as a Data Analyst for Amazon and the recruiting department has asked me for help. They want to create more jobs in Europe without having to expand their offices, therefore they are looking for people that are willing to work from home all the time. They are looking for people with prior expirence in the fields of Data Analysts, Data Scientits and Data Miners. Moreover they want to launch a new campaing that shows that Amazon cares and believes in the importance of helping rural areas to combat their problem of decreasing population, therefore all candidates must live in rural areas or in the countryside.
